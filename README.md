I started at 12 but end up just finish around 5 for the first pages, It has been a little while since using Vue so It took a while
I don't think I had enough time to finish the other page but it will be very quick since I only need to do the body for the second page

Had some issue the css formating and I am just using some icon from the internet, the logo is a bit off but that is the best I get from crop from the pdf
